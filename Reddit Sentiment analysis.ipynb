everything youve saying mountain salt time youve repeatedly shown dont know talking granted dont think thats due intentionality simply ignorance interesting would say stand betrays quite bit reverse projection looks like feigned ignorance much intentional thats completely discretion government application rule law us arbitrary two people commit crime one prosecuted another rule law us subjective objective certainly every case gets pursued legal system system designed arbitrary exercise power checked restrained someone else one exercising power central tenet rule law vs rule man check exists check allowed exist look trump example apropos routinely destroyed data required preserve federal law legal consequences faced yea bullshit trump get away stuff like trump fined millions cases previous presidents also fined fact trump even risk indicted proof rule law us china vastly different rule makers enforcers cannot held accountable case government decided rescind request rather pursue action exactly legal challenge worked mean misconception stopped havent ruling struck onerous aspects gag order didnt even strike gag order entirety original form werent allowed talk anyone anyone even lawyer allowed seek legal counsel struck allowed talk lawyer allowed acknowledge got nsl werent back still cant talk contents nsl thats even today giants like apple google give sum number nsls receive details still nondisclosure provisions gag currently issued nsls court ruling rescinding gag order merrill specific case strike entirely dont take quote context gag orders resulted details actions known people change policies isnt case anymore case nsls arbitrary unjustified would left completely unchecked able talk counsel prevented chance checks counteraction admit challenges struck gag orders opinion one egregious parts statute dont get wrong step right direction hardly enough read responses nowhere support nsls fact also opinion erode rule law secrecy makes hard keep check mean us devolved point rule law legal recourse challenge gag order nsl legal recourse per link challenge gag order yes advocacy groups challenge laws time nsl struck partially reinstated another court particular moment still effect mean legal recourse exhausted fact court strike means system working well could struck another court based different argument nsls us supreme court held type information nsls obtain constitutionally protected reasonable expectation privacy person already provided information third party eg telephone company longer reasonable expectation privacy information therefore fourth amendment requirement obtain court approval obtain information nonetheless nsl recipient may still challenge nondisclosure provision federal court scotus made ruling regarding nsls assertion type information nsls obtain constitutionally protected reasonable expectation privacy merely based precedent even precedent holds constitutionality nsls could challenged many ways lame dismissal ive said theres expectation parity exactly youre finally admitting yes parity claiming us unabashedly china utterly rubbish china quite blunt says us claim ideals makes betray ideals even damning called hypocrisy yes us claims ideals people abuse powers trampling ideals system builtin processes place people check counter uphold ideals plenty people us continue fight ideal china hand doesnt even care ideals entire constitution worthless way leaders violate held accountable avoiding article thats confusing things thats religion thats politics dalai lama head state pledging loyalty foreign power generally even us course religious dalai lama spiritual leader tibetan buddhism pope spiritual leader catholic church disingenuous want wont change fact looking head faith inherently religious thats say political well dichotomy even going even us anyone free pledge loyalty dalai lama pope even frigging l ron hubbard dont mix religion politics thats supposed us intention reality separation church state eroding since founding fathers much didnt happen th century something say glance dollar bill tells fact religious affiliation anyone running political office big deal cements yes totally agree separation church state much eroding super legitimate concern interestingly concern us one religion interfering state therefore interfering religious beliefs china state interfering thats big red line china dont challenge rule administration yes youre admitting leaders china cannot challenged thats heart matter isnt everything deemed political whim religion art even sports big red line means limit recourse thus borrowing quote surprise expectation parity regarding risk data hands chinese companies vs us company hypocrisy would us actually china yet called nsls may abomination even remotely level china china public private entities even push back change things trying downplay threats saying us simply intellectually dishonest best downright harmful worst well admit us bad things without trivialising perils regimes,fair enough dont go holiday much wouldnt using vr also prefer demo vr friends highest quality possible much showing power pc vr experience damn
